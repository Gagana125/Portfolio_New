            I am Gagana Samarasekara, a final-year Computer Science undergraduate at the University of Colombo School of Computing.
            I am passionate about technology, with a strong interest in both Augmented Reality (AR) and web development.
            I enjoy exploring innovative ways to create impactful applications that blend creativity with functionality.
            Over the years, Iâ€™ve successfully balanced academics with extracurricular activities, which has shaped me into a well-rounded individual.

            During my school and university years, I actively participated in sports, with table tennis being my main focus, and won several tournaments.
            I was also involved in clubs like AIESEC and Rotaract, where I gained valuable experience in teamwork and leadership.
            These experiences have taught me how to collaborate effectively and take on leadership roles when needed.
            I bring this same dedication and enthusiasm to all my projects and look forward to contributing to exciting challenges in both AR and web development.
          </p>

            In addition to my technical expertise, I pride myself on being a determined and goal-oriented individual who thrives in dynamic environments. 
            I am eager to apply my skills and experiences to develop innovative solutions, contribute to impactful projects, and grow as a professional in the tech industry.
